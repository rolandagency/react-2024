            Committedly Focused on Enriching the Lives of the Underprivileged,
            both in our Local Community and in Haiti. Since its establishment in
            2016, Way to Health has provided vital medical services to more than
            12,000 patients through mobile clinics and personalized care at an
            individual level. Although our primary emphasis is on Cite Soleil,
            Haiti—arguably one of the world's most impoverished slums—we also
            extend our efforts to other regions in Haiti and individuals within
            our local community. Our commitment to serving the most vulnerable
            reflects the essence of Proverbs 19:17, which declares, "Whoever is
            kind to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will reward them for what
            they have done.

                by supporting Way to Health, enabling us to sustain crucial care
                for the underprivileged. A mere $1 can furnish medicine for a
                malnourished baby, potentially saving their life. Your
                contribution makes a significant impact on those in need.

                Expansion of the Malnourished Baby Feeding Initiative As we
                conclude 2023, unite with us to broaden our feeding initiative.
                We aim to extend the feeding program from 34 malnourished babies
                to 90, reaching more communities by expanding into additional
                neighborhoods in Cite Soleil, Haiti. (Add in a LEARN MORE link

            <sup>6</sup> Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap
            sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
            <br />
            <sup>7</sup> Each of you should give what you have decided in your
            heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a
            cheerful giver
            <sup>8</sup> And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all
            things at all times, having all that you need ,you will abound in
            every good work.
            <sup>9</sup> As it is written:
            <blockquote>
              "They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor; their
              righteousness endures forever."<sup>[a]</sup>
            </blockquote>
            <sup>10</sup> Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for
            food will also supply and increase your store of see and will
            enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. <sup>11</sup> You will be
            enriched in every way so that you can be generous aon every
            occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving
            to God
